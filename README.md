No in-game screenshots are shipped here. The mark is original pack branding, not a Bandai Namco / Shueisha / TV Tokyo asset.

## Why this repo is small

GitHub will not hold a 9.29&nbsp;GB mod tree. This repository is the **readme, notes, and license/attribution files** so the pack has a public home without pretending the binaries live in `git clone`.

```text
this repo     NOTES.md, README, community files
not in git    the .xfbin pack (5,841 files / 427 folders)
on Releases   split 7z, two parts, for people who want the archive
you provide   Naruto Shippuden: Ultimate Ninja Storm 4 (PC)
```

## What’s in the archive (not in this clone)

From [`NOTES.md`](NOTES.md) and the v1.0.0 release notes:

- Storm 4 mod files (`.xfbin`) — effects, skills, sound, characters
- `My save/STORM4.S` — a **personal save** (130&nbsp;KB). Review it before you keep or share it.
- Verified layout: 5,841 files, 427 folders, 9.29&nbsp;GB uncompressed
- Compressed 7z: 2,221,758,792 bytes (two volumes × 1,110,879,396 bytes)
- Archive test recorded in notes: `7z t` → `Everything is Ok`

The game itself is **not** included.

## Download the archive

The git tree will never contain the pack. GitHub Release **[v1.0.0](https://github.com/ShugokiFable/naruto-storm4-modpack/releases/tag/v1.0.0)** attaches a split 7z because a single file would exceed the 2&nbsp;GB release-asset cap.

1. Download **both** parts into the same folder:
   - `Naruto.Shippuden.Ultimate.Ninja.Storm.4.Woomodpack-2.7z.001` (1,110,879,396 bytes)
   - `Naruto.Shippuden.Ultimate.Ninja.Storm.4.Woomodpack-2.7z.002` (1,110,879,396 bytes)
2. Extract the first part. 7-Zip follows `.002` automatically.

```bat
:: Windows — 7-Zip on PATH
7z x "Naruto.Shippuden.Ultimate.Ninja.Storm.4.Woomodpack-2.7z.001"
```

```sh
# macOS / Linux — p7zip
7z x "Naruto.Shippuden.Ultimate.Ninja.Storm.4.Woomodpack-2.7z.001"
```

Other mirrors and a local zip pointer (not in git) are listed in [`NOTES.md`](NOTES.md).

## Project map

```text
README.md     this file
NOTES.md      release notes, archive sizes, save-file warning
LICENSE       docs license; each mod keeps its author’s terms
docs/images/  pack mark only
```

There is no installer script and no game folder overlay in this repository.

## Honest status

Verified:

- this repository is documentation / attribution only
- v1.0.0 release assets exist at the names and byte sizes above
- notes record 5,841 files / 427 folders / `7z t` OK

Not claimed:

- the archive is inside `git clone`
- a first-party character-by-character credits table (this pack is a personal/community bundle — see NOTES)
- in-game screenshots
- affiliation with Bandai Namco, CyberConnect2, Shueisha, or TV Tokyo
